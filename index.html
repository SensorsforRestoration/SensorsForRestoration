      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Have you ever wondered how technology and innovation can tackle some of the world's most pressing environmental challenges? 
        In collaboration with the <strong>Weather Makers</strong>—a pioneering team of scientists and ecologists dedicated to regreening the Sinai Peninsula—
        this seminar offers an exciting chance to engage directly in a real-world environmental initiative. Together, we will address the 
        critical need for affordable, long-term water quality monitoring devices for <strong>Lake Bardawil</strong>, a vital lagoon ecosystem in the Sinai.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of relying on costly, off-the-shelf equipment, students will creatively leverage cutting-edge techniques in 
        <strong>Computer Vision</strong> and <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> to develop novel, low-cost sensors capable of monitoring salinity, nitrates, 
        nitrites, and other essential water properties. Throughout the semester, student teams will collaboratively explore vital design considerations, 
        including sensor mobility (anchored vs. roaming), optimal solar panel and battery sizing, data communication protocols, and data acquisition methods.
      </p>

      <p>
        Participants gain hands-on experience through prototyping and iterative design, using digital fabrication methods such as 3D printing, 
        CAD design, and advanced electronics assembly. Students will rigorously test their buoyant sensor prototypes in the Charles River and 
        nearby brackish environments analogous to Lake Bardawil, ensuring these devices can reliably operate in realistic conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        This seminar provides an immersive experience blending technology, environmental science, teamwork, and innovation. 
        It aims not only to build practical engineering and design skills but also to encourage students to envision how their work 
        can positively impact ecosystems worldwide.
