# Sensors for Restoration

Low‑cost buoy sensors (Seeed XIAO ESP32‑S3) that measure depth, salinity and temperature and send compact telemetry over ESP‑NOW. The project also features a low-cost modular colormetric system for measuring varius aquactic quality indicators (Redfield ratio).

In collaboration with Weather Makers, this seminar explores low-cost, long-term water-quality monitoring for Lake Bardawil in the Sinai; tracking salinity, nitrates, nitrites, and other key properties. Students prototype buoyant sensors, evaluate power, mobility, communication, and data acquisition, then field-test in the Charles River and nearby brackish sites analogous to Bardawil.

Why Bardawil? Sedimentation has limited seawater exchange, leaving a shallow, hypersaline lagoon with degraded fisheries; restoring exchange and monitoring ecology are central to regional recovery. At larger scale, automating restoration tasks helps proven interventions reach impact in remote, hazardous settings.
