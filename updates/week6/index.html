      <h3>Week 6 Team Updates</h3>
      <p><b>Enclosure:</b> Cut PVC pipes with different lengths to accurate flatness to prevent any water inflow in the future; brainstormed on anchoring and additional buoyancy constraints. Cork material didn't work; will test out various lengths with styrofoam and with our inflatable buoy in the coming week.</p>

      <p><b>Communications:</b></p> 
      <p>Set up the sender Arduino and the receiver Arduino. Managed to get them to communicate roughly 150m apart. This was in the Science Centre where there were lots of concrete walls so hopefully in the Sinai it will be possible to communicate over a larger distance. Set up the code for the sender and receiver. Created data packets for the data to be sent between the Arduinos.</p>

      <p><b>Sensing team:</b></p>
      <p>This class we completed the same experiment as last class but used the camera to classify each color in the tube using HSL and hex values. We performed the nitrate tests on three different concentration groups 25, 50, and 100 ppm to get a total of 12 different values. We also added the nitrate Solution 2 from the expired API test kit to a clear test tube to see how the solids in the solution would settle if left undisturbed.</p>
