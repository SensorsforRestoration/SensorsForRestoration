      <h3>Week 8 Team Updates</h3>
      <p>
        Here's a new para.

      <p>Plan  to use solvent cement as sealant after speaking with Andy Whitman. Planning on creating a detailed CAD representation of the sensor including electronic components</p>

      <p><b>Sensing</b></p>
      <p>After learning that we only needed to mix the phosphate solution once, we discussed different methods of mixing we could test in future weeks. One such method is adding all 12 drops of the reagent to the bottom of the test tube first before adding the water. Another such method we discussed is alternating between adding reagents and water in the hopes that the solution will mix with itself with each addition. We are hoping to test this process with nitrate as well. 

We also attempted to collect more nitrate test data with a wider range of concentrations. We plan to repeat the test from week 5 using just conditions #3 and #4 and classify the colors using the camera. We calculated the amount of KNO3 pellets we would need to obtain the desired nitrate concentrations. However, we ran into some issues with the scale not being precise enough to measure the masses of pellets we would need. To try to get around this issue, we added enough pellets to reach a mass of one gram. We then counted the number of pellets we needed to determine the number of grams per pellet.
