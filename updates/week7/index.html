      <h3>Week 7 Team Updates</h3>

      <p><b>Communications:</b></p> 
      <p>Worked on creating a function so the clock on the Arduino in the sensor is synced whenever it sends data to the Arduino collecting the data. Used NTP to sync the clock by sending packets from the receiver sensor to the sensor on the Arduino. Integrated the depth sensing code to the sensor and receiver code.</p>

      <p><b>Electronics:</b></p> 
      <p>This week, we figured out how the wires will be attached to the equipment. Each wire is tightly wrapped around the nail (clavo) before being secured back onto the device. So far, I was able to successfully attach one wire and nail connection, and we’ll be working on getting the remaining three attached next.

      <p><b>Housing</b></p>
      <p>Worked on finding optimal lengths for the water sensor body to maximize vertical stability in water. Traveled to Charles River to test. Result, longer PVC pipe with center of mass at the bottom creates more vertical stability. The less amount of PVC showing above the water allows for less effect on vertical stability from the wind.</p>
