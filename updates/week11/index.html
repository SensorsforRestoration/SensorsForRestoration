      <h3>Week 11 Team Updates</h3>
      <p>Housing</p>
      <p>Tested with point masses today, was not able to stabilize unless mass distribution was very close to perfectly
        uniform, helping us realize that
        sand worked well because of its uniform density and center of mass distribution - will have to calculate pretty
        precisely when it comes to actually putting everything altogether.
        We may require to print a few perfect circular disks that wil help stabilize and put everything on the same
        plane. This will be pretty trivial tho.
        Need to slowly start getting data about what we need to integrate for other teams.</p>
      <p>Assembly</p>
      <p>Designed a holder for the battery and the arduino, with the board and the capsule for detecting
        the color of the solution. Currently its on the print!
      </p>
      <p>Salinity</p>
      <p>
        Researched methods to secure wires onto screws. Found ring terminals and other joints are probably the best
        option. Will continue with trying assembly with new materials next class.
      </p>
      <p><b>Communications</b></p>
      <p>
        Data from sensors can now be read off the SD card and uploaded to an InfluxDB instance. New code is in
        <code>code/ingest/</code> and <code>code/platform/</code> respectively.
