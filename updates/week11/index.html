      <h3>Week 11 Team Updates</h3>
      <p>Housing</p>
      <p>Tested with point masses today, was not able to stabilize unless mass distribution was very close to perfectly uniform, helping us realize that
      sand worked well because of its uniform density and center of mass distribution - will have to calculate pretty precisely when it comes to actually putting everything altogether.
      We may require to print a few perfect circular disks that wil help stabilize and put everything on the same plane. This will be pretty trivial tho.
      Need to slowly start getting data about what we need to integrate for other teams.</p>
