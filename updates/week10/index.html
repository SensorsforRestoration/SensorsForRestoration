      <h3>Week 10 Team Updates</h3>
      <p><b>Housing</b></p>
      <p>Teted various masses with sand with our made prototype - got ranges for stability in tank situation. Must keep in note that this is
      not the same salinity as lake bardawill, so this data will be useful for getting the range and deviation in which we have to work in.
      We have confirmed that for certain masses our system will be more than stable enough! (restores to normal even when tilted 90 degrees horizontally.)
      Here is the data (in grams, total mass of the system): 
      1550 - tilted at a 10 degree angle(seems to be the instability border)
      1640 -	Tilted at a 15 degree angle 
      1775 - tilted at around 45 degree angle - still has restoring force
      1825 - tilted at around 50 degree angle - still has restoring force even when oriented horizontally.
      1950 (total) → stable tilted around 80 degree angle
      1990 - stable horizontally.
      2035 - stable (even when horizontally oriented stands upright afterwards)
      2240 - (borderline stable) but Has enough restoring force to come up even when oriented completely horizontally
      2300 - only red part is above water  but still has restoring foce even when oriented horizontally. Seems stable.
      2340 (this is the borderline point for our current system) 
      2375 - sinks (unstable)
      2490 - unstable - just falls down
