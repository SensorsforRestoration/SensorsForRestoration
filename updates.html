      <h3>Week 3 Team Updates</h3>
      <p>Buoyancy test complete. Considering alternative material for perpendicular stabilizer (more environmentally
        friendly). Drilled four stainless steel screws into bottom. Drilled JSN-SOR4T sensor hole using 7/8th spade bit
        for tight seal. Temporarily hot glued JSN-SOR4T sensor into hole for seal. Set up sensor with arduino and tested
        in water tub. </p>

      <h3>Week 4 Team Updates</h3>
      <p>Communications: Pushed basic code to <code>code/esp32</code> folder and established packet structure.
        Researched data storage methods, current thinking SD Card -> OSS InfluxDB.</p>

      <h3>Week 5 Team Updates</h3>
      <p>Depth Sensing: Went down to the charles. Tested the depth sensor off the bank. Had to get quite far in and went for a swim.
        Found that neeeded to be greater than 1m in order to asccurately measure and not give minimum values of around 1m.
        But success overall! No problem with the measuring cone.
  From enclosure team:
        JSN-SOR4T depth sensor problem regarding water depth and cone span solved. 
        Enclosure team thought about alternative material to use for stabilizing effect on PVC sensor enclosure. 
        Created sketch looking at Forces to consider. Thought about anchor attachment as well (included in diagram).
